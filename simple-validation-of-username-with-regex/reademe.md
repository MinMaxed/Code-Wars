Problem Domain: 
Write a simple regex to validate a username. Allowed characters are:

lowercase letters,
numbers,
underscore
Length should be between 4 and 16 characters (both included).

Overview: This one wasn't that bad. regex is one of those "difficult to understand, but easy to use" kind of things. The syntax with the various //'s, how \d = 0-9, etc don't seem that intuitive, but Ii can at least use them.
