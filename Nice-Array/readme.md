A Nice array is defined to be an array where for every value n in the array, there is also an element n-1 or n+1 in the array.

example:

[2,10,9,3] is Nice array because

2=3-1
10=9+1
3=2+1
9=10-1


overview: this one was tricky. Required a lot more conditions than I expected, had major issues with it declaring true too soon.
