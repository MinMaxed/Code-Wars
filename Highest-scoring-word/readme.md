Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to it's position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.


overview: This one was really tough. We rabbit holed a lot during the whiteboarding, but even after pulling ourselves back up it took some time. used a lot of google to look up the charCodeAt which is still confusing and I was reluctant to use it, but also want to get these done to focus on the labs.
