Given a string, capitalize the letters that occupy even indexes and odd indexes separately, and return as shown below. Index 0 will be considered even.

For example, capitalize("abcdef") = ['AbCdEf', 'aBcDeF']. See test cases for more examples.

The input will be a lowercase string with no spaces.

Good luck!

overview: after a lot of trial and error, I found the answer by searching and refactoring a solution found online. I still don't really like the solution, I mostly understand whats happening, but I feel like its too verbose and has a number of steps that could be simplified. If I had more time, I would mess with it more.
