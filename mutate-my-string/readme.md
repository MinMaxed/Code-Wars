I will give you two strings. I want you to transform stringOne into stringTwo one letter at a time.

Example:

stringOne = 'bubble gum';
stringTwo = 'turtle ham';

Result:
bubble gum
tubble gum
turble gum
turtle gum
turtle hum
turtle ham

overview: 
solution found from 'futurebound' on github. I tried to refactor it into a forEach instead of a for loop, but honestly I've been struggling so hard with the lab this week that I haven't had the energy or time to allocate to these code wars.
